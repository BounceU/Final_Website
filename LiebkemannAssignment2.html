            <h1>APUSH Paper</h1>
            <h2>By Ben Liebkemann</h2>
            <h2>Introduction</h2>

            <p>
                From 1877 to 1914, American society changed in a number of major ways due to muckrakers and activists calling attention to social issues, but even so, the status of many impoverished groups in America remained the same. The period from 1877 to 1914 highlights
                the <em>Gilded Age</em> along with the <em>Progressive Era</em>. The <em>Gilded Age</em> is characterized as the period of time in the mid-to-late 1800s where everything seemed great in the United States—industrialization
                booming and high society flourishing—but behind the scenes corruption in the government and lower-class poverty running rampant. The <em>Progressive Era</em>, meanwhile, brought forward new ways of running the country with a surge of technological
                and ideological innovation in America.
            </p>

            <h2>Trusts and Monopolies</h2>
            <p>
                Along with the ever-increasing growth of industry in the <em>Gilded Age</em> came people trying to rise against the corruption present in those industries. “<strong>Captains of American Industry</strong>” like Rockefeller or Carnegie often
                were able to undercut their workers for profit. Jay Gould was questioned by Congress about his railroad monopoly in 1887, but he defended himself by saying his monopoly was beneficial to the American people (Doc 1). This is the argument
                that many used in defense of monopolies and, on some level, it was true. The Standard Oil Company lowered the price and improved the quality of oil. These monopolies did, however, hurt smaller businesses and buy them up while mistreating
                their workers. John Sherman was an Ohio Senator who could be classified as a <strong>muckraker</strong> (Doc 2). He wanted to end the corruption of industry found in the big monopolies and so appealed to Congress and created the <strong>Sherman Anti-trust Act</strong>.
                This act tried to curb monopolies and make business fairer in America. While some monopolies remained, they were largely halted by legislation like the <strong>Sherman Anti-trust Act</strong> and <strong>Interstate Commerce Act</strong>,
                as well as other governmental and societal pushback.
            </p>

            <h2>Labor</h2>

            <h3>Organized Chaos</h3>

            <p>
                The <em>labor movement</em> was a strong force during this period that caused major societal change. The workers and lower-class citizens of America routinely participated in strikes to facilitate change in working conditions. Many of
                these Strikes and demonstrations ended up backfiring, like the unsuccessful <strong>Great Railway Strike of 1877</strong> or the disastrous <strong>Haymarket Square riot</strong> that resulted in the deaths of many and the downfall of
                the <strong>Knights of Labor organization</strong>, some organizations like the <strong>American Federation of Labor</strong> found success in gaining better pay for workers. Work and labor framed the lives of most Americans, though. The
                8-hour workday was nonexistent and without a job you couldn’t live or support your family. This forced children to work in order for families to survive. Labor was very important in American society, so the reforming of that labor had
                a profound impact on American life. Laborers across America even united in a march on Washington D.C. as “<strong>Coxey’s Army</strong>.” Cheap labor boosted the economy but lowered the overall health of American citizens who were lucky
                they even had a job.
            </p>


            <h3>Racial "Harmony"</h3>

            <p>
                Labor also brought together two groups that had very rarely cooperated on good terms in the past: whites and blacks in the South. For the benefit of everyone, black voters in the South were willing to shrug off party and racial allegiances and vote for
                whoever would give the “<em>laboring man his just rights and privileges</em>” (Doc 3). Reverend Moore, who wrote this quote, was still not treated as an equal by whites in the south, though. Reconstruction might have ended,
                but there was still persecution and differentiation between whites and blacks. The African American movement didn’t make much progress after reconstruction ended and was locked in place by the decision in <strong>Plessy v. Ferguson</strong>                where the “<em>separate
        but equal</em>” mentality was legalized. Throughout the time period from 1877 to 1914, life for black Americans didn’t improve much.
            </p>


            <h3>Children and Women in Force</h3>

            <p>
                The <em>child labor</em> and the <em>education reform movement</em>, which often went hand-in-hand with the push for women’s rights, was also a big deal during the later <em>Gilded Age</em> and <em>Progressive Era</em>. <strong>Muckrakers</strong>                like Jacob Riis published articles, books, and pictures of how children and low-class citizens were being mistreated which garnered much support for the cause against child-labor and for expanded workers’ rights (Doc 4). His book <em>How the Other Half
        Lives</em> showed many how terrible the living condition was for some Americans. Americans became more active in trying to right these wrongs, changing society greatly. This change prompted women like Jane Addams to create tenement houses like
                <strong>Hull House</strong>. Other women, like Florence Kelley, became active on the education front, advocating for public schools and for child labor to be made illegal (Doc 5). Women taking a frontal role in political issues was a large
                change from their classical roles of housework. Women taking political stances was made easier due to men’s focus on labor. Women were free to focus on other aspects of life that needed to be improved.
            </p>

            <h2>Conclusion</h2>

            <p>
                Therefore, be it through women taking stances in politics, labor disputes, or trying to end corruption in the government, American society was changed greatly by many reform movements from 1877 to 1914. For many, though, America didn’t change and stayed
                largely the same as it had been, which was the case for African Americans during this time. On the whole, though, America changed greatly, and many reform movements did succeed where others had previously failed.
